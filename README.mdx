# Honeycomb Protocol Usage Demos (Vue.js)

This repository contains a collection of demos that showcase how to use the Honeycomb Protocol with a Vue.js implementation.

## Steps

There are two ways to set up the demos:

### 1. Update the `.env` File

1. Before proceeding with the setup, you need to update the `.env` file at the root of this repository with the following values:

```
RPC_ENDPOINT=<Public RPC Endpoint>
API_URL=<Public API URL>
HPL_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=<Your HPL Project Public Key>
```

Ensure that you replace `<Your Honeycomb Project Public Key>` with your actual project key.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

OR

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Project

To start the project locally, run:

```bash
yarn serve
```

OR

```bash
npm run serve
```

Your project will now be accessible on http://localhost:8080 (or another port as configured).
